        <p>
          A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent
          shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
          shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened
          laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
          shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several
          times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
          called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
          similar to a puff pastry.
